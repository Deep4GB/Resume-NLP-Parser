# Resume NLP Parser

## Overview

The Resume NLP Parser is a project that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract and analyze information from resumes. This tool aims to simplify the process of reviewing job applicants' resumes, extracting relevant data, and making data-driven decisions in recruitment.

## Key Features

- **Resume Parsing**: The application parses resumes in various formats, such as PDF, Word documents, or plain text, extracting details like name, contact information, skills, work experience, and education.

- **NLP Analysis**: Natural Language Processing techniques are used to analyze the text within resumes, identifying keywords, phrases, and patterns to assess a candidate's qualifications.

- **Data Visualization**: The parsed data is presented through interactive and informative data visualizations, making it easier for recruiters to evaluate applicants.

- **Search and Filtering**: The tool provides search and filtering capabilities, allowing recruiters to find specific candidate information quickly.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies and tools:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for NLP and data analysis.

- **NLP Libraries**: NLP libraries and tools like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and spaCy are employed for text analysis.

- **Web Interface**: A web-based user interface is developed using streamlit.

- **Data Visualization**: Libraries like Matplotlib and Plotly are used for creating data visualizations.

## How to Run the Application

To run the Resume NLP Parser:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Set up the necessary Python environment with required libraries. You can use `pip` to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

 3. streamlit run app.py in terminal

4. Upload resumes

5. Use the provided search and filtering functionalities to explore the parsed data.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements for this project may include:

- **Machine Learning**: Integration of machine learning algorithms to improve resume analysis and categorization.
