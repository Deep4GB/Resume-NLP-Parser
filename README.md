# Resume NLP Parser

## Overview

The **Resume NLP Parser** is a project that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract and analyze information from resumes. This tool streamlines the process of reviewing job applicants' resumes, extracting relevant data, and enabling data-driven decisions in recruitment.

## Key Features

- **Resume Parsing**: Parses resumes in various formats (PDF, Word documents, or plain text), extracting details such as name, contact information, skills, work experience, and education.

- **NLP Analysis**: Utilizes Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze the text within resumes, identifying keywords, phrases, and patterns to assess a candidate's qualifications.

- **Data Visualization**: Presents parsed data through interactive and informative visualizations, facilitating recruiters in evaluating applicants.

- **Search and Filtering**: Provides search and filtering capabilities, enabling recruiters to quickly find specific candidate information.

## Technologies Used

The project is developed using the following technologies and tools:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for NLP and data analysis.

- **NLP Libraries**: Utilizes NLP libraries and tools like NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and spaCy for text analysis.

- **Web Interface**: Features a web-based user interface developed using Streamlit.

- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes libraries such as Matplotlib and Plotly for creating visualizations.

## How to Run the Application

To run the Resume NLP Parser:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
